# course-inventory

## Overview

The course-inventory application is designed to gather current-term Canvas LMS data about courses, enrollments, and users in order to inform leadership at the University of Michigan about the status and utilization of Canvas courses. Currently, the application collects data from the Canvas API and the Unizin Data Warehouse and then stores the data in an external MySQL database. Tableau dashboards and other processes then consume that data to generate reports and visualizations.

## Development

### Pre-requisities

The sections below provide instructions for configuring, installing, using, and changing the application. Depending on the environment you plan to run the application in, you may also need to install some or all of the following:
   * [Python 3.7](https://docs.python.org/3/)
   * [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
   * [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   * [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html)

While performing any of the actions described below, use a terminal, text editor, or file utility as necessary. Some sample command-line instructions are provided for some steps.

### Configuration

To configure the application before installation and usage (see the next section), you must first perform a few steps, including the creation of a configuration file called `env.json`. Complete the following items in order.

1. Clone and navigate into the repository.
    ```
    https://github.com/tl-its-umich-edu/course-inventory.git  # HTTPS
    git@github.com:tl-its-umich-edu/course-inventory.git      # SSH
    
    cd course-inventory
    ```

2. If you plan to run the application using `virtualenv`, you will need to have MySQL installed on your machine and create a test database and user (these will be added to `env.json` in step 4).

3. Copy the template configuration file, `env_blank.json` from the `config` directory, re-name it `env.json`, and place it inside the `secrets` subdirectory.
    ```
    mv config/env_blank.json config/secrets/env.json
    ```

4. Change the default values inside `env.json` (empty strings, `0`s, and provided values) with the desired values, ensuring they are the same data type. The table below describes the meaning and expected values of each key-value pair.

    **Key** | **Description**
    ----- | -----
    `LOG_LEVEL` | The minimum level for log messages that will appear in output. `INFO` or `DEBUG` is recommended for most use cases; see [Python's logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).
    `CANVAS_ACCOUNT_ID` | The Canvas instance root account ID number associated with the courses for which data will be collected.
    `CANVAS_TERM_ID` | The Canvas instance term ID number that will be used to limit the query for Canvas courses.
    `API_BASE_URL` | The base URL for making requests using the U-M API Directory; the default value should be correct.
    `API_SCOPE_PREFIX` | The scope prefix that will be added after the `API_BASE_URL`; this is usually an acronym for the university location and the API Directory subscription name in CamelCase, separated by a `/`.
    `API_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME` | The name of the API Directory subscription all in lowercase.
    `API_CLIENT_ID` | The client ID for authenticating to the API Directory.
    `API_CLIENT_SECRET` | The client secret for authenticating to the API Directory.
    `MAX_REQ_ATTEMPTS` | The number of times a specific request will be attempted.
    `WAREHOUSE_INCREMENT` | A 17-digit number that will be added to Canvas IDs to create Unizin Data Warehouse IDs.
    `CREATE_CSVS` | A boolean (`true` or `false`) indicating whether CSVs should be generated by the execution.
    `INVENTORY_DB` | An object containing the necessary credential information for connecting to a MySQL database, where output data will be inserted.
    `UDW` | An object containing the necessary credential information for connecting to the Unizin Data Warehouse, where data will be pulled from.

### Installation & Usage

#### Docker is coming!

A `docker-compose.yml` file -- that will let you run and test the MySQL database population -- is in the works! For now, please use `virtualenv` (see below).

#### With a Virtual Environment

You can also set up the application using `virtualenv` by doing the following:

1. Create a virtual environment using `virtualenv`.
    ```
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # for Mac OS
    ```

2. Install the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Initialize the database using `create_db.py`.
    ```
    python create_db.py
    ```

4. Run the application.
    ```
    python inventory.py
    ```

#### OpenShift Deployment

Deploying the application as a job using OpenShift and Jenkins involves several steps, which are beyond the scope of
this README. However, a few details about how the job is configurd are provided below.

* The `env.json` file described in the **Configuration** section above needs to be made available to 
  running course-inventory containers via an OpenShift ConfigMap, a type of Resource. A volume containing the ConfigMap 
  should be mapped to the `config/secrets` subdirectory. These details will be specified in a configuration file
  (.yaml) defining the pod.

* By default, the application will run with the assumption that the JSON configuration file will be named `env.json`. 
  However, `inventory.py` will also check for the environment variable `ENV_PATH`. This variable can be set using the 
  OpenShift pod configuration file. To use a different name for the JSON file, set `ENV_PATH` to a path beginning with 
  `config/secrets/` and ending with the file name. With this set, the `env` block in the `.yaml` will look 
  something like this:
  ```
  - env:
      - name: ENV_FILE
        value: /config/secrets/env_test.json
  ```

### Database Management and Schema Changes

Currently, the database is version-controlled and managed using the [`yoyo-migrations` Python library](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/). The migration files are located in the `db/migrations` directory.

To make changes to the database schema, perform the follow steps in order.

1. Add a new migration file to the `migrations` directory called `XXXX.add_something.py`, where `XXXX` is the next migration number (preceded by `0`s until the number is four digits) and `add_something` is an action describing the change made.

2. Within the file, import the `step` function from `yoyo`, and then for each desired schema change, pass a SQL string to `step`. Multiple step invocations can be enclosed in a list and assigned to a `steps` variable. Place each `step` in the order it should be applied.

Refer to the first migration, `0001.init_inventory_db.py`, if an example is needed.
